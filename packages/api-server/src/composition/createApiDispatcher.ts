/**
 * `createApiDispatcher` — dispatcher composition root for the API trunk
 * (architecture.md §6.1, ADR 0018, ADR 0023).
 *
 * The dispatcher is the single orchestration path between surface
 * adapters and capability handlers. Every surface consumes the same
 * `Dispatcher` value; this factory builds it against a concrete driver
 * + registry so the trunk can hold one process-scoped instance.
 *
 * **Why this lives in api-server rather than `@editorzero/dispatcher`.**
 * `packages/dispatcher` owns the orchestration semantics (parse → gate
 * → invoke → parse → audit, write-path tx rollback shape, audit
 * projection). It takes `runInWriteTx` / `runRead` / `withAuditTx` as
 * injected dependencies because those mechanics vary by deployment
 * posture — the exact shape used here (tenant-scoped `ctx.db` derived
 * from `principal.workspace_id`, `AuditTx` from `asAuditTx(tx)`,
 * `transact` wired to `HocuspocusSync.bind(ctx)` when `sync` is
 * provided) is a *deployment* decision, not a *dispatcher* decision.
 * So the factory that makes those choices lives where the trunk lives.
 *
 * **Driver parameter is `SqliteDriver` today; widens to `SqliteDriver
 * | PostgresDriver` once Postgres integration lands in a follow-up
 * slice** (ADR 0023). The driver surface (`.withSystemTx`, `.system()`,
 * `.scoped()`) is the same across both; this factory reads only that
 * surface, not SQLite-specific bits, so the widening is mechanical.
 *
 * **`sync` is optional.** When a `HocuspocusSync` is passed, the
 * write-path `ctx.transact` routes through `sync.bind({ sqlTx,
 * principal, workspace_id })` — same pattern proven in
 * `packages/dispatcher/src/writepath.integration.test.ts`. Handler
 * throw triggers `bound.rollback()` so the in-memory Y.Doc is dropped
 * and the next `ctx.transact` re-hydrates from committed
 * `doc_updates` (P3.6e). When `sync` is absent, `ctx.transact` throws
 * a descriptive error — tests and smokes that don't exercise content
 * mutations don't need to boot Hocuspocus.
 *
 * **Read-path `ctx.transact` routes through `HocuspocusSync.read`.**
 * `doc.get` calls `ctx.transact(doc_id, fn)` in `category: "read"`
 * context to project the block array from the Y.Doc. The sync seam's
 * tx-less `read(doc_id, fn)` variant (landed alongside this wiring)
 * opens a DirectConnection with an internal `__read` marker so
 * `onLoadDocument` hydrates via the untransacted reader (no RESERVED
 * lock contention with `runInWriteTx`'s `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`), snapshots
 * the live Y.Doc under the per-doc mutex, and hands `fn` a
 * throwaway clone — handler mutations can't pollute resident state.
 * When `sync` is absent, `runRead.ctx.transact` throws a descriptive
 * error (same posture as the write path). The read surface will
 * formalise as a distinct `ctx.readDoc` in the next slice (kernel
 * split); for now the single `ctx.transact` entry multiplexes on
 * `category`.
 *
 * **`outbox` remains a no-op stub** — the metadata-only mutation
 * atomicity artefact (continuation.md §Immediate focus) lands this
 * together with a capability that emits handler-owned outbox rows.
 * No capability registered today actually emits via `ctx.outbox`;
 * the stub is safe under that precondition.
 *
 * **`now: () => Date.now()` default** keeps tests deterministic by
 * letting them override with a fake clock. Production inherits the
 * real wall clock; observability spans read the same `now` so the
 * audit row's timestamp agrees with the span's start time.
