/**
 * `PersistentWorkspaceState` — the projection invariant 3a reconstructs.
 *
 * Invariant 3a (AGENTS.md / architecture.md §9.1): *"every mutation
 * produces exactly one audit entry; the audit log alone reconstructs
 * final state."* This module defines what *"final state"* means for the
 * replay reducer in `./reducer.ts`: the **semantic metadata projection**
 * of a workspace — which workspaces / members / collections / docs exist,
 * their identity, hierarchy, doc read-scope, attribution, and whether they
 * are soft-deleted.
 *
 * It is a *projection*, not a row-for-row mirror of `@editorzero/db`. The
 * reducer folds the audit **row** (envelope + effect — see `ReplayRow`) and
 * is *purely effect-driven*: every projected field reads from the effect
 * body, never from the envelope principal. (`created_by` used to reconstruct
 * from `principal_id`; that was wrong for an agent write — the effect now
 * carries the handler-resolved human attribution. Codex review HIGH 1.) The
 * boundary list below *is* the honesty surface of invariant 3a — what
 * reconstructs, what doesn't, and why — so it is enumerated here rather than
 * left implicit:
 *
 *  1. **`created_at` / `updated_at` are NOT reconstructable — by construction.**
 *       The handler stamps the entity row via `ctx.now()`; the audit writer
 *       stamps the audit row via its own `now()` — *different ticks* — and the
 *       create effect bodies carry neither. So the audit log cannot reproduce
 *       those exact values; the projection drops them.
 *
 *       `deleted_at` is the exception (Codex review HIGH 4): the soft-delete
 *       handlers RETURN the exact `ctx.now()` they wrote to the row, the
 *       `*.soft_delete` / `member.remove` effects now CARRY that value, and the
 *       reducer projects it verbatim — so `deleted_at` reconstructs precisely
 *       (the handler's clock, not the audit row's), preserving the ADR 0017
 *       recovery-window anchor across replay. `restore` resets it to `null`;
 *       `create` / `member.add` start it at `null`.
 *
 *  2. **Server-minted secrets — never audit-derived, by design.**
 *     - `workspaces.diagnostic_salt` (16 random bytes, F64). Not domain
 *       state; replaying the log must NOT reproduce a secret.
 *
 *  3. **`trash_retention_days` / `settings` ARE reconstructed (Codex review HIGH 3).**
 *       `workspace.create` carries both (no longer DDL-default guesses) and
 *       `workspace.update` carries them in its patch, so an admin who changes
 *       retention or settings is reflected in the projection. `settings` is
 *       the parsed object (the form `workspace.get` exposes), not the stored
 *       JSON string.
 *
 *  4. **Monotonic bookkeeping — derivable, deferred.**
 *     - `docs.visibility_version` (count of publish/unpublish/delete/
 *       restore effects). Reconstructable by replay derivation; deferred to
 *       keep the first contract tight. Promoting it is additive.
 *
 * **Genesis caveat (also a review question).** The signup bootstrap writes
 * the `workspaces` row + the owner `workspace_members` row directly via
 * `driver.system()` in a Better Auth after-hook — it does NOT dispatch a
 * capability, so it emits NO `audit_events`. Those rows are therefore part
 * of *genesis* state, not audit-reconstructable. The resolution (Codex
 * review HIGH 2) is to EMIT `workspace.create` + `member.add` from the
 * bootstrap under an audited `workspace.bootstrap` system-mutation marker —
 * closing invariant 3 for signup — rather than seed replay with genesis.
 * That lands in its own slice; until it does, a replay over a freshly-
 * signed-up workspace will not contain the root workspace / owner rows.
 *
 * **The `docs` read-scope field is the ADR 0040 Step-5 seam.** Today it is
 * the live overloaded `visibility ∈ {workspace, public, private}` column;
 * Step 5 splits it into `access_mode ∈ {space, private}` + `published_at`.
 * The reducer sets this field in exactly two places (`doc.create` initial,
 * `doc.publish`/`doc.unpublish` flip), so the split lands as an additive
 * transform — not a reducer rewrite. The property compares this field
 * against whatever the live `docs` columns are, so it tracks the schema.
